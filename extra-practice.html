      <h1>Extra Practice and Troubleshooting</h1>

      <p>
        It can&#39;t be said enough -- one of the best ways to learn to code is
        to sit down and work on an exercise or project and learn as you
        go. You&#39;ll get lots of errors, but those are actually a great way to
        understand how Python works.

      <h3>Getting an error or want to learn about a specific topic?</h3>

      <p>Before you give up entirely, a simple Google search can often lead you to the answer to your problems. Finding the answers takes a bit of skill, though. It&#39;s a well-known secret that programmers need to be good at searching to find the right answers. Here&#39;s some tips for finding the best search terms and the best answers for your problem -</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you&#39;re getting an error, type that exact wording of the error and ideally what you were doing to cause it.</li>
        <li>Know what you&#39;re working with. It can help to add which version of Python you&#39;re using, the Operating System, even things like the module you&#39;re working with.</li>
        <li>Be patient. Sometimes you have to look at a few different pages before you find a solution that works for you.</li>
        <li>Don&#39;t be afraid to look up words or concepts that are unfamiliar to you in an answer. It may seem daunting, but it&#39;s all part of learning to program.</li>
        <li>At this point it&#39;s a good idea to re-read your code. Sometimes you see a simple answer that you were missing before.</li>
      </ul>
