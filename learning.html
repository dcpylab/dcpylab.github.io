      <p>
        If you&#39;re looking at this, you&#39;re already taking steps to learn
        Python. Congratulations! Hopefully we&#39;ll see you at a PythonLab to
        learn more, but we know there&#39;s a wide range of interests, learning
        styles, and levels of commitment out there. That&#39;s why we put together
        a list of other resources for learning Python available online and in the
        DC area.
      </p>

      <p>
        Try out a few, see what works for you! Let us know if you have any
        particular good or bad experiences with something of if we haven&#39;t
        listed a resource you like.
      </p>

      <p>There are too many blogs and tutorials out there to list here, though. And since often the best way to learn is just to do some coding, check out the page on <a href="www.github.com/necaris/pythonlab-classes/extra_practice.md">Extra Practice and Troubleshooting</a></p>

      <h2>In-person Help</h2>

      <p>Going to Meetups is a great way to learn more about Python. Even if you feel like the topic is too advanced for you they&#39;re a great way to share ideas with other learners and expose yourself to new ideas.</p>
